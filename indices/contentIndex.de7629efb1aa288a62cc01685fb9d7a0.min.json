Purgatory (hell realms, impermanent) 2. Asuras (jealous beings) 3. Ghosts 4. Animals 5. Humans 6. Devas of the Four Great Kings (9 million years) 7. The 33 Gods (36 million years) 8. Yama devas (144 million years) 9. Contented devas (576 million years) 10. Devas delighting in creation (2.3 billion years) 11. Devas wielding power over others‘ creations (9.2 billion years) Numbers 1 – 11 are in the realm of the sense world, can experience sense pleasures and displeasures, mostly pleasure for the devas (impermanent gods or angels). 12. Retinue of Brahma (one-third of an aeon) [1] 13. Ministers of Brahma ((half an aeon) [1] 14. Great Brahmas (one aeon) [1] 15. Devas of limited radiance (2 aeons) [2] 16. Devas of unbounded radiance (4 aeons) [2] 17. Devas of streaming radiance (8 aeons) [2] 18. Devas of limited glory (16 aeons) [Third jhana, minor degree] 19. Devas of unbounded glory (32 aeons) [Third jhana, medium degree] 20. Devas of refulgent glory (64 aeons) [Third jhana, highest degree] 21. Very fruitful devas (500 aeons) [4] 22.

Clear-sighted devas (8,000 aeons) [4] 27. Peerless devas (16,000 aeons) [4] Numbers 12 – 27 are in the realm of form. There is a subtle body and these deva realms are superior to those in the sense realm. One attains rebirth to these planes based on kamma and spiritual attainments. Attainment of certain jhanas at the time of death or sometime during your life can lead to these levels. The jhana level associated with the levels above is shown in [brackets]. 28. Sphere of Infinity of Space (20,000 aeons) 29. Sphere of Infinity of Consciousness (40,000 aeons) 30. Sphere of No-thingness (60,000 aeons) 31. Sphere of Neither Perception nor Non-Perception (84,000 aeons) Numbers 28 – 31 are in the realm of the formless. This means there is no body of any kind. There is just a type of consciousness, conventional existence as we know it, but without a body. The life spans are very long in the formless realm and one attains to these levels by the formless jhanas these planes are named after, jhanas or realms 5 to 8. Numbers 28- 31 are not necessarily the best places to be. At these levels, one cannot hear the Dhamma from a Buddha or arahant on earth or any other planet. The best destinations are the pure abodes at numbers 23 – 27 which are deva realms for nonreturners. Rebirth to these planes means that enlightenment will be attained while at one of these planes of existence.","lastmodified":"2023-02-11T10:20:25.930549684Z","tags":null},"/12/32-Parts-of-the-Body":{"title":"32 Parts of the Body","content":"\n (for reflection on their impure and impermanent nature): 1.

He has the mark of a thousand-spoked wheel on the soles of his feet (Pali: he thapadatalesu cakkani jatani). 3. He has projecting heels (Pali: ayatapa ni). 4. He has long fingers and toes (Pali: digha nguli). 5. His hands and feet are soft-skinned (Pali: mudutalahathapado). 6. He has netlike lines on palms and soles (Pali: jalahathapado). 7. He has high raised ankles (Pali: ussa nkhapado). 8. He has taut calf muscles like an antelope (Pali: e nimigasadisaja ngho). 9. He can touch his knees with the palms of his hands without bending. (Pali: thitako va anonamanto). 10. His sexual organs are concealed in a sheath (Pali: kosohitavatguyho). 11. His skin is the color of gold (Pali: suva n nava no). \"His body is more beautiful than all the gods.\" (Lakkhana sutta) 12. His skin is so fine that no dust can attach to it (Pali: sukhumacchavi). 13. His body hair are separate with one hair per pore (Pali: ekekalomo). 14. His body hair are blue-black, the color of collyrium, and curls clockwise in rings. (Pali: uddhagalomo). 15. He has an upright stance like that of brahma (Pali: brahmujugatto). 16. He has the seven convexities of the flesh (Pali: satusado). Note: \"the seven convex surfaces,/ on both hands, both feet, both shoulders, and his trunk.\" (Lakkhana Sutta) 17. He has an immense torso, like that of a lion (Pali: sihapuba dhakayo). 18. The furrow between his shoulders is filled in (Pali: pitantara mso). 19. The distance from hand-to-hand and head-to-toe is equal (Pali: nigrodhaparima n dalo). Note: incidentally, these are also the ideal proportions according to Leonardo Da Vinci‘s Vitruvian Man. 20. He has a round and smooth neck (Pali: samva dakhando). 21. He has sensitive taste-buds (Pali: rasagasagi). 22. His jaw is like that of lion's (Pali: sihahanu). 23. He has a nice smile 24.

He has a large, long tongue (Pali: pahutajivho). 28. He has a voice like that of Brahma (Pali: brahmasaro hiravikabha ni). 29. He has very blue eyes (Pali: abhi nila netto). Note 1: \"very (abhi) blue (nila) eyes (netto)\" is the literal translation. Nila is the word used to describe a sapphire and the color of the sea, but also the color of a rain cloud. It also defines the color of the Hindu God Krishna. Note 2: \"His lashes are like a cow's; his eyes are blue. Those who know such things declare 'A child which such fine eyes will be one who's looked upon with joy. If a layman, thus he'll be/ Pleasing to the sight of all. If ascetic he becomes, Then loved as healer of folk's woes.'\" (Lakkhana Sutta) 30. He has eyelashes like an ox (Pali: gopa mukho). 31. He has a white soft wisp of hair in the center of the brow (Pali: una loma bhamukantare jata). Note: this became the symbolic urna. 32. His head is like a royal turban (Pali: u nahisiso). Note that this denotes his cranial protrusion, visible on Buddhist iconography. This is not part of Buddhism, but rather a remnant from Brahmanism and other ancient beliefs. When the seer Asita came to visit the new born Buddha-to-be, Siddhattha Gotama, he mentions that he sees the signs or marks of a great man and lists some of them. This confirms that this concept is a pre-Buddhist idea.","lastmodified":"2023-02-11T10:20:25.930549684Z","tags":null},"/12/33-synonyms-for-nibbana":{"title":"33 synonyms for nibbana","content":"\n: 1.

Having a good Dhamma friend (Kalyāna-mitta): Such friend has a pure and beautiful mind, which by simply being a good example will influence and encourage all other beings to improve their mentality, behaviour and understanding. Such good friend encourages one to learn, train and develop one self towards individual and social harmony. \n 2. Completion of Pure Morality (Sīla-sampadā): Having a minimum of 5 precept moral discipline is the indispensable foundation of right life. This means living harmlesslyand helpfully, and not exploitatively, both within the material and social environment, by using the four necessities of food, clothing, shelter and medicine as well as any technology, so they enhance a true quality of one's own and others beings life, by promoting education, constructive action, merit-making and the state of balance in nature. \n 3. Consummation of Motivation (Chanda-sampadā): Having a mind that is motivated by withdrawal and good-will, which aims at learning and doing good. Not obsessed by only wanting more, getting low consumer pleasure. Instead, one uses all one's abilities in joyous learning of how to do only good things, avoid all evil things and purify one's mind into a subtle radiant excellence. \n 4. 4: Perfection of One-self (Atta-sampadā): By dedicating oneself to the realization of one's full human potential through daily meditation. One views all difficulties, hardships, obstacles and problems as good training grounds to test and improve one's mind, intelligence and abilities toward the realization of one's full potential, through a comprehensive refinement, that encompasses mentality, behaviour, and understanding. \n 5. Clarification of Understanding (Ditthi-sampadā): Seeing that all things has a cause and an effect is adhering to the principle of conditionality. This comprehension of the vast mutual dependency of all mental and material states in the universe comes from repeated reasoning, thorough examination and excellence of rational analysis. This enables mental clarity and intellectual independence, neither being impulsive, nor over-reactive, not allowing oneself to drift along the stream of public hysteria and banal common priorities. \n 6. Achievement of Alertness (Appamada-sampadā): To be acutely and constantly aware of the inevitable impermanence, inherent instability, transience, fleeting evanescence and total insubstantiality of all life, all things and all phenomena, which are constantly changing according to their causes and conditions, both internally and externally, will establish oneself in alertness. One realizes, that one cannot afford to be complacent. One sees the preciousness of time and strives to learn about, prevent and rectify the causes of decline and bring about the causes of growth and prosperity, using all one's time, night and day to the greatest advantage. \n 7. Fulfillment of Rational Attention (Yoniso-manasikara-sampadā): Attending wisely so as to what is the cause of any phenomena or state, will make one advantageously realize the real truth. To investigate, by intelligently examining, investigating, tracing, analyzing and researching into the very proximate cause of any given situation, will make one able to solve problems and do things successfully through intelligent methods, that allows one to be independent, self-reliant and at the same time, by that self-sufficiency, become a helping refuge to many other people and beings.\n\n \n (from Samyutta Nikaya V. 29-31)","lastmodified":"2023-02-11T10:20:25.934549688Z","tags":null},"/7/7-good-qualities-of-a-Dhamma-follower":{"title":"7 good qualities of a Dhamma follower","content":"\n 1.

You should set the environment variable `HUGO_BASEURL=http://your-public-ip` and then start your container.\n2. Set up port forwarding on your router from port `p` to `your-local-ip:1313`.\n3. You should now be able to access Quartz from outside your local network at `http://your-public-ip:p`.\n\nHowever, your HTTP connection will be unencrypted and **this method is not secure**.\n\n### To a Domain using Cloudflare Proxy\n\n1. Port forward 443 (HTTPS) from your machine.\n2. Buy a custom domain (say, `your-domain.com`) from [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar/). Point a DNS A record from `your-domain.com` to your public IP address and enable the proxy.\n3. Set the environment variables `HUGO_BASEURL=https://your-domain.com`, `HUGO_PORT=443`, and `HUGO_APPENDPORT=false`. Change `1313:1313` to `443:443` for the `ports` in `docker-compose.yml`.\n4. Spin up your Quartz container and enjoy it at `https://your-domain.com`!\n\n### To a Domain using a Reverse Proxy\n\nIf you want to serve more than just Quartz to the internet on this machine (or don't want to use the Cloudflare registrar and proxy), you should follow the steps in the section above (as appropriate) and also set up a reverse proxy, like [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik).
