Purgatory (hell realms, impermanent) 2. Asuras (jealous beings) 3. Ghosts 4. Animals 5. Humans 6. Devas of the Four Great Kings (9 million years) 7. The 33 Gods (36 million years) 8. Yama devas (144 million years) 9. Contented devas (576 million years) 10. Devas delighting in creation (2.3 billion years) 11. Devas wielding power over others‘ creations (9.2 billion years) Numbers 1 – 11 are in the realm of the sense world, can experience sense pleasures and displeasures, mostly pleasure for the devas (impermanent gods or angels). 12. Retinue of Brahma (one-third of an aeon) [1] 13. Ministers of Brahma ((half an aeon) [1] 14. Great Brahmas (one aeon) [1] 15. Devas of limited radiance (2 aeons) [2] 16. Devas of unbounded radiance (4 aeons) [2] 17. Devas of streaming radiance (8 aeons) [2] 18. Devas of limited glory (16 aeons) [Third jhana, minor degree] 19. Devas of unbounded glory (32 aeons) [Third jhana, medium degree] 20. Devas of refulgent glory (64 aeons) [Third jhana, highest degree] 21. Very fruitful devas (500 aeons) [4] 22.

Clear-sighted devas (8,000 aeons) [4] 27. Peerless devas (16,000 aeons) [4] Numbers 12 – 27 are in the realm of form. There is a subtle body and these deva realms are superior to those in the sense realm. One attains rebirth to these planes based on kamma and spiritual attainments. Attainment of certain jhanas at the time of death or sometime during your life can lead to these levels. The jhana level associated with the levels above is shown in [brackets]. 28. Sphere of Infinity of Space (20,000 aeons) 29. Sphere of Infinity of Consciousness (40,000 aeons) 30. Sphere of No-thingness (60,000 aeons) 31. Sphere of Neither Perception nor Non-Perception (84,000 aeons) Numbers 28 – 31 are in the realm of the formless. This means there is no body of any kind. There is just a type of consciousness, conventional existence as we know it, but without a body. The life spans are very long in the formless realm and one attains to these levels by the formless jhanas these planes are named after, jhanas or realms 5 to 8. Numbers 28- 31 are not necessarily the best places to be. At these levels, one cannot hear the Dhamma from a Buddha or arahant on earth or any other planet. The best destinations are the pure abodes at numbers 23 – 27 which are deva realms for nonreturners. Rebirth to these planes means that enlightenment will be attained while at one of these planes of existence.","lastmodified":"2023-02-11T09:41:12.341982475Z","tags":null},"/12/32-Parts-of-the-Body":{"title":"32 Parts of the Body","content":"\n (for reflection on their impure and impermanent nature): 1.

He has the mark of a thousand-spoked wheel on the soles of his feet (Pali: he thapadatalesu cakkani jatani). 3. He has projecting heels (Pali: ayatapa ni). 4. He has long fingers and toes (Pali: digha nguli). 5. His hands and feet are soft-skinned (Pali: mudutalahathapado). 6. He has netlike lines on palms and soles (Pali: jalahathapado). 7. He has high raised ankles (Pali: ussa nkhapado). 8. He has taut calf muscles like an antelope (Pali: e nimigasadisaja ngho). 9. He can touch his knees with the palms of his hands without bending. (Pali: thitako va anonamanto). 10. His sexual organs are concealed in a sheath (Pali: kosohitavatguyho). 11. His skin is the color of gold (Pali: suva n nava no). \"His body is more beautiful than all the gods.\" (Lakkhana sutta) 12. His skin is so fine that no dust can attach to it (Pali: sukhumacchavi). 13. His body hair are separate with one hair per pore (Pali: ekekalomo). 14. His body hair are blue-black, the color of collyrium, and curls clockwise in rings. (Pali: uddhagalomo). 15. He has an upright stance like that of brahma (Pali: brahmujugatto). 16. He has the seven convexities of the flesh (Pali: satusado). Note: \"the seven convex surfaces,/ on both hands, both feet, both shoulders, and his trunk.\" (Lakkhana Sutta) 17. He has an immense torso, like that of a lion (Pali: sihapuba dhakayo). 18. The furrow between his shoulders is filled in (Pali: pitantara mso). 19. The distance from hand-to-hand and head-to-toe is equal (Pali: nigrodhaparima n dalo). Note: incidentally, these are also the ideal proportions according to Leonardo Da Vinci‘s Vitruvian Man. 20. He has a round and smooth neck (Pali: samva dakhando). 21. He has sensitive taste-buds (Pali: rasagasagi). 22. His jaw is like that of lion's (Pali: sihahanu). 23. He has a nice smile 24.

He has a large, long tongue (Pali: pahutajivho). 28. He has a voice like that of Brahma (Pali: brahmasaro hiravikabha ni). 29. He has very blue eyes (Pali: abhi nila netto). Note 1: \"very (abhi) blue (nila) eyes (netto)\" is the literal translation. Nila is the word used to describe a sapphire and the color of the sea, but also the color of a rain cloud. It also defines the color of the Hindu God Krishna. Note 2: \"His lashes are like a cow's; his eyes are blue. Those who know such things declare 'A child which such fine eyes will be one who's looked upon with joy. If a layman, thus he'll be/ Pleasing to the sight of all. If ascetic he becomes, Then loved as healer of folk's woes.'\" (Lakkhana Sutta) 30. He has eyelashes like an ox (Pali: gopa mukho). 31. He has a white soft wisp of hair in the center of the brow (Pali: una loma bhamukantare jata). Note: this became the symbolic urna. 32. His head is like a royal turban (Pali: u nahisiso). Note that this denotes his cranial protrusion, visible on Buddhist iconography. This is not part of Buddhism, but rather a remnant from Brahmanism and other ancient beliefs. When the seer Asita came to visit the new born Buddha-to-be, Siddhattha Gotama, he mentions that he sees the signs or marks of a great man and lists some of them. This confirms that this concept is a pre-Buddhist idea.","lastmodified":"2023-02-11T09:41:12.341982475Z","tags":null},"/12/33-synonyms-for-nibbana":{"title":"33 synonyms for nibbana","content":"\n: 1.

Having a good Dhamma friend (Kalyāna-mitta): Such friend has a pure and beautiful mind, which by simply being a good example will influence and encourage all other beings to improve their mentality, behaviour and understanding. Such good friend encourages one to learn, train and develop one self towards individual and social harmony. \n 2. Completion of Pure Morality (Sīla-sampadā): Having a minimum of 5 precept moral discipline is the indispensable foundation of right life. This means living harmlesslyand helpfully, and not exploitatively, both within the material and social environment, by using the four necessities of food, clothing, shelter and medicine as well as any technology, so they enhance a true quality of one's own and others beings life, by promoting education, constructive action, merit-making and the state of balance in nature. \n 3. Consummation of Motivation (Chanda-sampadā): Having a mind that is motivated by withdrawal and good-will, which aims at learning and doing good. Not obsessed by only wanting more, getting low consumer pleasure. Instead, one uses all one's abilities in joyous learning of how to do only good things, avoid all evil things and purify one's mind into a subtle radiant excellence. \n 4. 4: Perfection of One-self (Atta-sampadā): By dedicating oneself to the realization of one's full human potential through daily meditation. One views all difficulties, hardships, obstacles and problems as good training grounds to test and improve one's mind, intelligence and abilities toward the realization of one's full potential, through a comprehensive refinement, that encompasses mentality, behaviour, and understanding. \n 5. Clarification of Understanding (Ditthi-sampadā): Seeing that all things has a cause and an effect is adhering to the principle of conditionality. This comprehension of the vast mutual dependency of all mental and material states in the universe comes from repeated reasoning, thorough examination and excellence of rational analysis. This enables mental clarity and intellectual independence, neither being impulsive, nor over-reactive, not allowing oneself to drift along the stream of public hysteria and banal common priorities. \n 6. Achievement of Alertness (Appamada-sampadā): To be acutely and constantly aware of the inevitable impermanence, inherent instability, transience, fleeting evanescence and total insubstantiality of all life, all things and all phenomena, which are constantly changing according to their causes and conditions, both internally and externally, will establish oneself in alertness. One realizes, that one cannot afford to be complacent. One sees the preciousness of time and strives to learn about, prevent and rectify the causes of decline and bring about the causes of growth and prosperity, using all one's time, night and day to the greatest advantage. \n 7. Fulfillment of Rational Attention (Yoniso-manasikara-sampadā): Attending wisely so as to what is the cause of any phenomena or state, will make one advantageously realize the real truth. To investigate, by intelligently examining, investigating, tracing, analyzing and researching into the very proximate cause of any given situation, will make one able to solve problems and do things successfully through intelligent methods, that allows one to be independent, self-reliant and at the same time, by that self-sufficiency, become a helping refuge to many other people and beings.\n\n \n (from Samyutta Nikaya V. 29-31)","lastmodified":"2023-02-11T09:41:12.345982434Z","tags":null},"/7/7-good-qualities-of-a-Dhamma-follower":{"title":"7 good qualities of a Dhamma follower","content":"\n 1.

Ensure that code block titles are enabled in Quartz's configuration:\n\n    ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\n    enableCodeBlockTitle: true\n    ```\n\n2. Add the `title` attribute to the desired [code block\n   fence](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#highlighting-in-code-fences):\n\n      ```markdown {linenos=false}\n       ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n       enableCodeBlockTitle: true  # example from step 1\n       ```\n      ```\n\n**Note** that if `{title=\u003cmy-title\u003e}` is included, and code block titles are not\nenabled, no errors will occur, and the title attribute will be ignored.\n\n### HTML Favicons\nIf you would like to customize the favicons of your Quartz-based website, you \ncan add them to the `data/config.yaml` file. The **default** without any set \n`favicon` key is:\n\n```html {title=\"layouts/partials/head.html\", linenostart=15}\n\u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThe default can be overridden by defining a value to the `favicon` key in your \n`data/config.yaml` file. For example, here is a `List[Dictionary]` example format, which is\nequivalent to the default:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon:\n  - { rel: \"shortcut icon\", href: \"icon.png\", type: \"image/png\" }\n#  - { ... } # Repeat for each additional favicon you want to add\n```\n\nIn this format, the keys are identical to their HTML representations.\n\nIf you plan to add multiple favicons generated by a website (see list below), it\nmay be easier to define it as HTML. Here is an example which appends the \n**Apple touch icon** to Quartz's default favicon:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon: |\n  \u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"180x180\" href=\"/apple-touch-icon.png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThis second favicon will now be used as a web page icon when someone adds your \nwebpage to the home screen of their Apple device. If you are interested in more \ninformation about the current and past standards of favicons, you can read \n[this article](https://www.emergeinteractive.com/insights/detail/the-essentials-of-favicons/).\n\n**Note** that all generated favicon paths, defined by the `href` \nattribute, are relative to the `static/` directory.\n\n### Graph View\nTo customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around `data/graphConfig.yaml`.\n\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/graphConfig.yaml\"}\n# if true, a Global Graph will be shown on home page with full width, no backlink.\n# A different set of Local Graphs will be shown on sub pages.\n# if false, Local Graph will be default on every page as usual\nenableGlobalGraph: false\n\n### Local Graph ###\nlocalGraph:\n    # whether automatically generate a legend\n    enableLegend: false\n    \n    # whether to allow dragging nodes in the graph\n    enableDrag: true\n    \n    # whether to allow zooming and panning the graph\n    enableZoom: true\n    \n    # how many neighbours of the current node to show (-1 is all nodes)\n    depth: 1\n    \n    # initial zoom factor of the graph\n    scale: 1.2\n    \n    # how strongly nodes should repel each other\n    repelForce: 2\n\n    # how strongly should nodes be attracted to the center of gravity\n    centerForce: 1\n\n    # what the default link length should be\n    linkDistance: 1\n    \n    # how big the node labels should be\n    fontSize: 0.6\n    \n    # scale at which to start fading the labes on nodes\n    opacityScale: 3\n\n### Global Graph ###\nglobalGraph:\n\t# same settings as above\n\n### For all graphs ###\n# colour specific nodes path off of their path\npaths:\n  - /moc: \"#4388cc\"\n```\n\n\n## Styling\nWant to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing `assets/styles/custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \n\n### Partials\nPartials are what dictate what gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\n\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`. To customize the footer, you can edit `/layouts/partials/footer.html`\n\nMore info about partials on [Hugo's website.](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/)\n\nStill having problems?

Hugo (and by proxy, Quartz) supports this natively.\n\nFollow the steps [Hugo provides here](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/#configure-languages) and modify your `config.toml`\n\nFor example:\n\n```toml\ndefaultContentLanguage = 'ar'\n[languages]\n  [languages.ar]\n    languagedirection = 'rtl'\n    title = 'مدونتي'\n    weight = 1\n```\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-11T09:41:12.345982434Z","tags":null},"/private/notes/custom-Domain":{"title":"Custom Domain","content":"\n### Registrar\nThis step is only applicable if you are using a **custom domain**!

You can organize content into any folder you'd like.\n\n**To edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.**\n\nTo create a link between notes in your garden, just create a normal link using Markdown pointing to the document in question. Please note that **all links should be relative to the root `/content` path**. \n\n```markdown\nFor example, I want to link this current document to `notes/config.md`.\n[A link to the config page](notes/config.md)\n```\n\nSimilarly, you can put local images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\nYou can also use wikilinks if that is what you are more comfortable with!\n\n### Front Matter\nHugo is picky when it comes to metadata for files. Make sure that your title is double-quoted and that you have a title defined at the top of your file like so. You can also add tags here as well.\n\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: \"Example Title\"\ntags:\n- example-tag\n---\n\nRest of your content here...\n```\n\n### Obsidian\nI recommend using [Obsidian](http://obsidian.md/) as a way to edit and grow your digital garden.

If you forked and cloned Quartz directly from the repository, everything should already be good to go! Follow the steps below.\n\n### Enable GitHub Actions\nBy default, GitHub disables workflows from running automatically on Forked Repostories. Head to the 'Actions' tab of your forked repository and Enable Workflows to setup deploying your Quartz site!\n\n![Enable GitHub Actions](notes/images/github-actions.png)*Enable GitHub Actions*\n\n### Enable GitHub Pages\n\nHead to the 'Settings' tab of your forked repository and go to the 'Pages' tab.\n\n1.

Set a custom domain here if you have one!\n\n![Enable GitHub Pages](/notes/images/github-pages.png)*Enable GitHub Pages*\n\n### Pushing Changes\nTo see your changes on the internet, we need to push it them to GitHub. Quartz is a `git` repository so updating it is the same workflow as you would follow as if it were just a regular software project.\n\n```shell\n# Navigate to Quartz folder\ncd \u003cpath-to-quartz\u003e\n\n# Commit all changes\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"message describing changes\"\n\n# Push to GitHub to update site\ngit push origin hugo\n```\n\nNote: we specifically push to the `hugo` branch here. Our GitHub action automatically runs everytime a push to is detected to that branch and then updates the `master` branch for redeployment.\n\n### Setting up the Site\nNow let's get this site up and running. Never hosted a site before? No problem. Have a fancy custom domain you already own or want to subdomain your Quartz? That's easy too.\n\nHere, we take advantage of GitHub's free page hosting to deploy our site. Change `baseURL` in `/config.toml`. \n\nMake sure that your `baseURL` has a trailing `/`!\n\n[Reference `config.toml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/config.toml)\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e/\"\n```\n\nIf you are using this under a subdomain (e.g. `\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz`), include the trailing `/`. **You need to do this especially if you are using GitHub!**\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz/\"\n```\n\nChange `cname` in `/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`. Again, if you don't have a custom domain to use, you can use `\u003cYOUR-USERNAME\u003e.github.io`.\n\nPlease note that the `cname` field should *not* have any path `e.g. end with /quartz` or have a trailing `/`.\n\n[Reference `deploy.yaml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml)\n\n```yaml {title=\".github/workflows/deploy.yaml\"}\n- name: Deploy  \n  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3  \n  with:  \n\tgithub_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # this can stay as is, GitHub fills this in for us!\n\tpublish_dir: ./public  \n\tpublish_branch: master\n\tcname: \u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e\n```\n\nHave a custom domain?

Here are a list of common questions and problems people encounter when installing Quartz.\n\nWhile you're here, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cRFFHYye7t) :)\n\n### Does Quartz have Latex support?\nYes! See [CJK + Latex Support (测试)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(测试).md) for a brief demo.\n\n### Can I use \\\u003cObsidian Plugin\\\u003e in Quartz?\nUnless it produces direct Markdown output in the file, no. There currently is no way to bundle plugin code with Quartz.\n\nThe easiest way would be to add your own HTML partial that supports the functionality you are looking for.\n\n### My GitHub pages is just showing the README and not Quartz\nMake sure you set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`! See more in the [hosting](/notes/hosting) guide\n\n### Some of my pages have 'January 1, 0001' as the last modified date\nThis is a problem caused by `git` treating files as case-insensitive by default and some of your posts probably have capitalized file names. You can turn this off in your Quartz by running this command.\n\n```shell\n# in the root of your Quartz (same folder as config.toml)\ngit config core.ignorecase true\n\n# or globally (not recommended)\ngit config --global core.ignorecase true\n```\n\n### Can I publish only a subset of my pages?\nYes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore%20notes.md).\n\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](notes/hosting.md).\n\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n```shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n```\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [Obsidian](notes/obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](notes/editing.md).\n\n### My custom domain isn't working!\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](notes/hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\n\n### How do I setup Google Analytics?\nYou can edit it in `config.toml` and either use a V3 (UA-) or V4 (G-) tag.\n\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\n\n### How do I change the colours?\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](notes/config.md).\n\n### How do I add images?\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\nBy default, the `linkIndex.json` (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](notes/editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\nQuartz isn't perfect!

Usually you should press `y` for most of these unless it conflicts with existing changes you've made! \n\n```shell\nmake update\n```\n\nOr, if you don't want the interactive parts and just want to force update your local garden (this assumed that you are okay with some of your personalizations been overriden!)\n\n```shell\nmake update-force\n```\n\nOr, manually checkout the changes yourself.\n\n\u003e ⚠️ **WARNING** ⚠️\n\u003e\n\u003e If you customized the files in `data/`, or anything inside `layouts/`, your customization may be overwritten!\n\u003e Make sure you have a copy of these changes if you don't want to lose them.\n\n\n```shell\n# add Quartz as a remote host\ngit remote add upstream git@github.com:jackyzha0/quartz.git\n\n# index and fetch changes\ngit fetch upstream\ngit checkout -p upstream/hugo -- layouts .github Makefile assets/js assets/styles/base.scss assets/styles/darkmode.scss config.toml data \n```\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-11T09:41:12.349982392Z","tags":null},"/private/test_folder/":{"title":"Nice Folder Title 1","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-02-11T09:41:12.349982392Z","tags":null},"/private/test_folder/other_test_folder_2/":{"title":"Nice Folder Title 2","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-02-11T09:41:12.349982392Z","tags":null},"/private/test_folder/other_test_folder_2/test_page_2":{"title":"Test Page 1","content":"\ntest\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-11T09:41:12.349982392Z","tags":null},"/private/test_folder/other_test_folder_2/test_page_20":{"title":"Test Page 2","content":"\ntest\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-11T09:41:12.349982392Z","tags":null},"/private/test_folder/other_test_folder_2/test_page_21":{"title":"Test Page 3","content":"test\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-11T09:41:12.349982392Z","tags":null},"/private/test_folder/other_test_folder_2/test_page_22":{"title":"Test Page 4","content":"test\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-11T09:41:12.349982392Z","tags":null},"/private/test_folder/test_page_1":{"title":"Test Page 01","content":"\ntest\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-11T09:41:12.349982392Z","tags":null},"/private/test_folder/test_page_10":{"title":"Test Page 02","content":"test\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-11T09:41:12.349982392Z","tags":null},"/private/test_folder/test_page_11":{"title":"Test Page 03","content":"test\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-11T09:41:12.349982392Z","tags":null},"/sources":{"title":"Sources","content":"\n- [Buddhist Dictionary](https://fractalcitta.github.io/Buddhist-Dictionary/dic_idx.html)\n- [Bhikkhu Manual](https://bhikkhu-manual.github.io/quotations.html/)\n- [The Complete Book of Buddha‘s Lists](https://www.thedhamma.com/buddhaslists.pdf): PDF\n- [Buddha Dhamma](https://www.thailandfoundation.or.th/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Buddhadhamma.pdf) : PDF\n- [Buddha Vacana](https://www.buddha-vacana.org/formulae.html) : Formula\n- [Leight Breisington](http://www.leighb.com/)\n- [Interactive Dhamma Guide](https://prezi.com/view/RuyJOGbbzqBZqQtGx8nl/) : Prezi Presentation, very good !\n- [Outilne of Buddhisme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_Buddhism)\n- [Buddhadust](http://buddhadust.net/)\n- [Access to Insight](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/ptf/index.html) : A Path to Freedom\n- [Lucid24](https://www.lucid24.org/sted/8aam/index.html) : Strang website\n![[attachements/DharmaLists.pdf]]","lastmodified":"2023-02-11T09:41:12.349982392Z","tags":null}}
