Four kinds of kamma: 

1. There is dark kamma with dark ripening 
2. There is bright kamma with bright ripening 
3. There is dark-and-bright kamma with dark-and-bright ripening 
4. There is kamma that is not dark and not bright with neither-dark-nor-bright ripening that conduces to the exhaustion of kamma 

(Majjhima Nikaya 57, Anguttara Nikaya 4.235)
