title: "8 Nutriments for Ignorance"

Monks, and ignorance too, I declare, is a specific condition. And due to its nutriment, it manifests. I declare: 
1. Ignorance has its nutriment: the five hindrances. 
2. The five hindrances have their nutriment: the three ways of wrong conduct. 3
3. . The three ways of wrong conduct have their nutriment: lack of sense restraint. 
4. Lack of sense restraint has its nutriment: lack of mindfulness and clear comprehension. 
5. Lack of mindfulness and clear comprehension has its nutriment: improper attention. 
6. Improper attention has its nutriment: lack of faith. 
7. Lack of faith has its nutriment: not listening to the true teachings. 
8. Not listening to the true teachings has its nutriment: not associating with superior people.
 
When non-association with superior people prevails, not listening to the true teachings will prevail. When not listening to the true teachings prevails, it will make a lack of faith prevailâ€¦. When the five hindrances prevail, they will make ignorance prevail. In this way, ignorance has its nutriment and becomes complete. A. V. 113-14.
