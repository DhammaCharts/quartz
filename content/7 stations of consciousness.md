 1. Diversity of body and diversity of perception (such as human beings, some devas, and some beings in the lower realms) 
 2. Diversity of body and singularity of perception (such as the devas of the Brahma hosts generated by the first jhana and some beings in the four realms of deprivation) 
 3. Beings with singularity of body and diversity of perception (such as the Radiant Devas) 
 4. Beings with singularity of body and singularity of perception (such as the Beautifully Lustrous Devas) 
 5. Beings who, with the complete transcending of perceptions of [physical] form, with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance, and not heeding perceptions of diversity, [perceiving] Infinite space, arrive at the dimension of the infinitude of space 
 6. Beings who, with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of space, [perceiving] Infinite consciousness, arrive at the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness 
 7. Beings who, with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness, [perceiving] there is no-thing, arrive at the dimension of nothingness
