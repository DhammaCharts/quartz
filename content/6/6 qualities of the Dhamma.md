1. ―Well-proclaimed‖ The Dhamma is not a speculative philosophy, but is the Universal Law found through enlightenment and is preached precisely. Therefore it is excellent in the beginning (moral principles), excellent in the middle (concentration, tranquility) and excellent in the end (wisdom). 
2. ―Able to be examined‖ The Dhamma can be tested by practice and therefore he who follows it will see the result by himself through his own experience. 
3. ―Immediate‖ The Dhamma is able to bestow timeless and immediate results here and now, for which there is no need to wait until the future or next existence. 
4. ―Come and see‖ The Dhamma welcomes all beings to put it to the test and come see for themselves. 
5. ―Leading one close to‖ The Dhamma is capable of being entered upon and therefore it is worthy to be followed as a part of one's life. 
6. ―To be personally known by the wise‖ The Dhamma can be perfectly realized only by the noble disciples who have matured and enlightened enough in supreme wisdom.
