 1. Do not believe in something just because it is reported 
 2. Do not believe in something just because it is tradition or culture 
 3. Do not believe in something just because it is hearsay 
 4. Do not believe in something just because the authorities say it is so 
 5. Do not believe in something just because it is in the scriptures 
 6. Do not believe in something thinking a god inspired it 
 7. Do not believe in something just by logic or inference alone 
 8. Do not believe in something because of speculative opinion 
 9. Do not believe in something just because your teacher says it is true (Help yourself, accept as completely true only that which you test for yourself, and know to be good for yourself and others.)
