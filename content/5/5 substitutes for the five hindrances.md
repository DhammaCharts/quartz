5 substitutes for the five hindrances: 1. Sense desire & lust (kama-chanda) should be substituted with attention on disgusting aspects. 2. Anger and ill-will (vyapada) should be substituted with infinite and universal friendliness. 3. Lethargy and laziness (thina-middha) should be substituted with enthusiastic energy. 4. Restlessness and regret (uddhacca-kukkucca) should be substituted with calm tranquillity. 5. Skeptical doubt and uncertainty (vici-kiccha) should be substituted with curious examination.
