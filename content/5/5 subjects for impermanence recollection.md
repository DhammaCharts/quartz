5 subjects for impermanence recollection: 1. I am of the nature to decay, I have not gone beyond decay. 2. I am of the nature to be diseased; I have not gone beyond disease. 3. I am of the nature to die; I have not gone beyond death. 4. All that is mine, dear, and delightful will change and vanish. 5. I am the owner of my kamma; the heir to my kamma; born of my kamma; related to my kamma; abide supported by my kamma. Whatever kamma I shall do, whether good or evil, of that I shall be the heir.
