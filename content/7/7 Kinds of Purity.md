Seven Kinds of Purity (M. I. 149-50; also, the entire text of the Visuddhimagga. At D. III. 289, two more kinds of purity are added at the end: paññā-visuddhi and vimutti-visuddhi. The commentaries explain that these two refer to arahattaphala-paññā and arahattaphala-vimutti, respectively (DA. III. 1062).) Moral Conduct: 
1. Purity of moral conduct (sīla-visuddhi) = pure conduct in accord with a person’s personal circumstances → Concentration: 
2. Purity of mind (citta-visuddhi) = ‘access concentration’ and higher forms of concentration → Wisdom: 
3. Purity of views (diṭṭhi-visuddhi) = knowledge of mind & body →
4. Purity of knowledge leading to the end of doubt (kaṅkhāvitaraṇavisuddhi) = an understanding of Dependent Origination → 
5. Purity of knowledge regarding Path and not-path (maggāmaggañāṇadassana-visuddhi) = encountering and going beyond the ‘defilements of in-sight’ (vipassanūpakilesa) → 
6. Purity of knowledge of the way of practice (paṭipadāñāṇadassanavisuddhi) = ‘insight knowledge’ (vipassanā-ñāṇa) → 
7. Purity of knowledge and vision (ñāṇadassana-visuddhi) = Path knowledge (magga-ñāṇa). {523}
